To group endpoints according to different characteristics (API version,
entity type, public / private, etc.), you can use the `@OpenAPIGroup` annotation.

With this annotation, you can specify which groups this endpoint belongs to and
which groups it should be excluded from. An annotation can be written at the method,
class or package level. You can also set binding to a group through the configuration,
if you do not want to add annotations in the code.

You can set some additional settings for the group through system properties / application.yml / openapi.properties:

Usage example:
[source,java]
----
@Controller
public class ApiController {

    @OpenAPIGroup("v2")
    @Post("/save/{id}")
    public String save2(String id, Object body) {
        return "OK!";
    }

    @OpenAPIGroup({"v1", "v2"})
    @Post("/save")
    public String save(Object body) {
        return "OK!";
    }
}
----

[configuration]
----
micronaut:
  openapi:
    groups:
      v1:
        #The title that will be displayed in the group selector in the UI
        display-name: My API v1
        # A flag indicating that the swagger UI should select this group in the selector by default.
        primary: true
        # The name of the final swagger file. If it is not set, then by default the name will be generated according
        # to the following pattern: swagger-<version>-<groupName>-<apiVersion>. version - application version from the main
        # OpenAPIDefinition annotation, api-version - version from micronaut @Version annotation
        filename: myapiv1
        # Whether to exclude common endpoints from this group
        common-exclude: true
        # An additional way to add or remove endpoints from a given batch group.
        # Strong package matching and inclusion of all subpackages is supported (* symbol)
        packages: com.micronaut.controller.v1.*
        packages-exclude:
          - com.micronaut.controller.v1
          - com.micronaut.controller
      v2:
        display-name: My API v2
      "v3.testv3group":
        packages-exclude:
         - com.micronaut.controller.v3
         - com.micronaut.controller

After processing the annotation processor, you will get 3 different swagger files.

== Integration with UI

In rapidoc and redoc do not support multiple files at the same time,
so for normal API display, you will have to complete the template yourself.

Swagger UI has support for multiple files out of the box. The example above would look something like this:
